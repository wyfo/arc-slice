//! The different layouts used by [`ArcSlice`] and [`ArcSliceMut`].
//!
//! A layout defines how the data is stored, impacting memory size and the behavior
//! of some operations like `clone`.
//!
//! Almost all layouts are compatible with each other: [`ArcSlice::with_layout`] and
//! [`ArcSliceMut::with_layout`] allows to update the layout used, often at zero cost. See
//! [`FromLayout`].
//!
//! [`ArcSlice`] and [`ArcSliceMut`] have a default layout, which can be overridden using
//! [crate features](crate#features).
//!
//! ## Which layout to choose
//!
//! The default layout, [`ArcLayout`], should support most of the use cases efficiently.
//! The other layouts are designed to support some particular buffers without allocating an inner
//! Arc:
//! - [`BoxedSliceLayout`] and [`VecLayout`] are intended for boxed slice/vector buffers,
//!   and should be used only when clones are unlikely;
//! - [`RawLayout`] should be used with [`Arc`] and other raw buffers.
//!
//! Since layout primarily affects [`ArcSlice`]/[`ArcSliceMut`] instantiation, libraries generally
//! donâ€™t need to worry about it: they can either accept the default layout or use a generic one
//! in public APIs, and expose the most appropriate layout in their return types. Libraries should not
//! override the default layout using [crate features], as it would impact every other crates.
//! <br>
//! Binaries should use the default layout, adapting it to the use case using [crate features].
//!
//! In any case, layout choice is primarily a performance concern and should be supported by
//! measurement.
//!
//! ## Layouts summary
//!
//! | Layout             | `ArcSlice` size          | static/empty slices support | arbitrary buffers support | cloning may allocate | optimized for      |

//! | `BoxedSliceLayout` | `3 * size_of::<usize>()` | yes                         | yes                       | yes                  | `Box<[T]>`         |
